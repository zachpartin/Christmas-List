## Title 
Virtual Christmas List

## Description 
An app that lets a user submit Christmas wishes by category. The main page displays buttons with categories of gifts. The user selects one which then takes them to a page with a form where they submit their wish, and the wish is posted to the page along with other wishes that are submitted in that category.

## API
 I plan on having a table for each toy category and being able to fetch and post to each one, from each corresponding component.

## MVP
 Build a website that allows you to submit a christmas wish via a form which will then post to the page. It will be divided into categories of gifts and the wish will post to the page for that category.

## Post-MVP

Add a slideshow/carousel with Christmas-y images for the app page

## SWOT Analysis 
I feel fairly confident with react, my biggest concern is with having different components display specific data rather than having one display all of it as most of the homeworks have done. Seems that it shouldn't be too too difficult with airtable though since you can call specific tables which I think should make it fairly simple.
